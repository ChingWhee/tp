## Overview

KitchenCTRL is a Java-based command-line application for managing kitchen inventory and recipes.
It supports inventory tracking, recipe storage, and provides a simple text interface optimized for 
usability and modular design.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

### Summary of Contributions

* **Feature Implementation** [\#30](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/30), [\#34](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/34), [\#40](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/40), [\#53](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/53) : `CatalogueContentManager`
    * *What it does*: Handles all loading and saving operations for the Inventory and RecipeBook catalogues, converting between structured text and in-memory objects. 
    * *Justification*: Since Inventory and RecipeBook use different text formats, a unified loading method would have led to error-prone code. I implemented separate parsing logic to ensure correctness and clarity.
    * *Highlights*: I abstracted the save logic into a single method by leveraging Java's polymorphism. Each catalogue class to be saved is supposed to have `getCatalogueContent()` to define its own serialization format, adhering to **encapsulation** and the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

* **Testing & Debugging**: 
    * *JUnit tests written*: `StorageTest.java` — extensively tested inventory and recipe file handling, including edge cases such as empty files and malformed entries. [\#70](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/70) `IngredientTest.java` — simply tested a few basic functionalities [\#40](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/44) 
    * *Bug Fixes*: Fixed multiple issues in `ParserTest.java` and `UiTest.java`, especially in `testWelcomeCommand_inventory` and `testWelcomeCommand_recipe`, where the debug output was misleading and required deep inspection of program state and test execution order. [\#60](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/60)

* **Code Quality Enhancements** [\#60](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/60):
    * Replaced non-standard characters (e.g., →) in documentation with more portable alternatives like `->` to ensure better cross-platform compatibility and readability. 
    * Adhered to Checkstyle and JavaDoc standards for all additions and modifications.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Fixed the markdown structure and did some updates.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Documented the architecture of `CatalogueContentManager`.
    * PPP:
        * Explained the different handling of Inventory and RecipeBook due to their text format differences.
